Title: Events for Bows

Authors: Elijah Saloma, Benjamin Bercasio, Daevin Bagcal, John Serraon, Yuzuki Fujimoto

For our final project we are going to make an event hosting site. The problem is that events on-campus that are advertised via posters are often ignored by the student body as the boards get cluttered and people don’t have time to read them. Even events that are advertised on boards on the ground might  So we will solve this problem by having a web page where all events are listed in categories in an organized fashion so that it is easier for students to find events they may be interested in. 
Some pages we plan on implementing are a main hub where events with high interest are displayed, a subscription page where users can subscribe to categories of events or other users to be updated on new events posted to the category or by the user, then we will also have a page where users can make their own events. Admin users will have the ability to approve, delete, and otherwise manage events, as well as “boost” events, or designate them as priority and show them on the main hub. Once approved, users will be able to sign up for events. 

Our beyond the basics component would entail a filtering with tags page that populates the users page with relevant events and content of interest. This would filter events using dates, interests, and types of events. We may also ask the user for their interests when they initially register, which would format preferred event categories to go to the top of the page.

Use cases for our application relate to members of our UHM campus community engaging with each other. Creating an event through the app can help users increase visibility of their event/activities, such as when campus members have pop-up fundraising booths, or special guest lectures are being hosted on campus. Third-party attendees of an event can also create an event page for it if it does not already exist, providing a helping hand in boosting its engagement. Because the user will be prompted to select their interest categories as part of their profile building, the application also enables students to find events and others in the community that share their interests. Users that are simply interested in browsing events on campus could also use the application for this purpose, since it provides a hub for all types of events sourced by fellow community members.
