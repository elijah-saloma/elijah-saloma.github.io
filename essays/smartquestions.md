## "There are no such things as Not so Smart questions"

I’m sure we’ve all had the experience where we were sitting in class and our teacher decided to say something along the lines of “There are no such things as not so smart questions”, typically in the beginning of the school year or amidst a completely silent classroom. The logic behind the phrase is that it is likely someone else could also benefit from the answer of our question, regardless if the teacher said something prior that answers it and even then, at least the one who asked would benefit as their question has been answered. 
For me personally, I’ve seen this phrase lose its meaning over time and honestly lost its weight. There are videos I can recall watching where a common punchline is of a school setting with the teacher saying the same exact phrase of “There are no such things as not so smart questions” then a student saying a clearly not so smart question for comedic effect. However, I still understand where the phrase is coming from. It’s not so much to ask a question without any thought behind it at all, but rather to at least ask a question in the pursuit of knowledge. Even so, there has to be a better way to ask these not so smart questions, right?
