<h1> Purpose </h1>
The Programming and Algorithms Club (PANDA Club) is a special interest group of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, with the focus of applying algorithmic problem-solving skills. PANDA Club holds weekly meeting, reinforcing these algorithmic problem-solving skills regularly through tackling algorithm problems akin to those you would encounter at a technical interview.

<h1> Role </h1>

As an officer (Big Panda), I am responsible for leading, facilitating, and teaching groups of students of varying levels. Typically the levels of our ICS Classes at UH Manoa (ICS 111, 211, 212, 311) are the levels of focus, differing on how deep we delve into the algorithms and problem-solving process. I am primarily responsible for mentoring those of the ICS 212 group, but still mentor those in any other group depending on their needs.
