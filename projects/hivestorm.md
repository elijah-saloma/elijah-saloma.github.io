<h1> Purpose </h1>
Hivestorm [website](https://www.hivestorm.org/) is a team cyber defense competition, focusing more on the defensive aspect (Blue Team) as opposed to the hacking aspect (Red Team). We are given a list of security issues to address, and correcting those issues gives teams points. Doing an action that harms the system would result in a reduction of points. We do these actions by using virtual machines with various Linux and Windows operation system versions. 

<h1> Role </h1>

As this was many of our first times participating in a competitive cyber defense competition, including myself, we did not organize each person to do an individual task or focus on a particular area, but all help eachother progress through the issues we had. These teams were hosted by the Greyhats club at UH Manoa, and we were given training for several weeks prior to the competition. We were taught to get used to Linux and virtual machines in general and how to address common issues provided by Hivestorm. 

This experience was very engaging for me, and heavily piqued my interest regarding cyber security along with associated career paths.
