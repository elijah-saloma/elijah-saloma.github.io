<h1> General Overview </h1>

The Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) is an annually held event that challenges professional, amateurs, and students to create solutions for local organizations and the community of Hawaii. One of the challenges that was proposed in 2023 was by Zero Waste Oahu, to keep track of reusable containers. FireSheep created a web application that kept track of the reusable plastic containers that were borrowed by the local community to prevent excess waste from being created. There was a QR code and ID scanner to keep track of these reusable plastic containers, along with a user interface to easily select your preferences.

<h1> The Experience </h1>

For this project, I was responsible for front-end development. As this was an application that allowed you to navigate multiple pages, I was tasked to make the user interface easily usable and to take into account how the user interface may function on your phone as opposed to a screen on a monitor. There were other people working on front-end development with me, so I had to also check their formatting and code, along with facilitating each of our tasks.

<h1> Takeaways </h1>

I believe this experience was incredibly beneficial to reinforcing team-based project skills, such as reliable and effective communication. Being able to work on the front-end with multiple people also allowed me to strengthen my skills in user-friendly interface development, along with reinforcing general HTML and CSS skills.

(Note: At the time, I was the only member of FireSheep who was not taking ICS314, thus not a recorded member on the ICS314 project page, which is the provided website, but I was still an official member on the team for HACC)
